# About this Repo

This Git Repo is based from the [official repo](https://github.com/docker-library/openjdk) for Docker OpenJDK images.

We just removed the images not based on Alpine Linux and define [bandsintown/alpine](https://github.com/bandsintown/docker-alpine) image as the base image in order 
to have Consul Template and GoDNSMasq setup.
